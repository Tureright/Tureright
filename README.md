## About Me

I’m passionate about software development in all its forms and applications: Programming, Automated Testing and UX/UI Design.
Although this GitHub space mainly showcases my coding and testing skills, I’d also like to **highlight my experience and strong interest in software design**, particularly in the following areas:

✨ Software architecture design, especially using the **C4 Model** approach.  
✨ User-centered product design and **user experience** (UX) design, applying techniques such as Design Thinking, UX Research, and core design principles.
